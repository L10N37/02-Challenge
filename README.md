## Description

This is the 'Week 1 Monash bootcamp challenge'!
The project was to add semantic structure to the HTML code, add appropriate commenting to the
CSS file, launch a live version of the site and provide an adequate readme with a screenshot of the site outlining the project.

The problems solved are that the original code was not structured or easily readable and has 
now being improved upon and optimised where possible.

By doing this project, I have learned a little about semantic structure and the general layout
of some HTML code and it's interaction with the CSS file.
